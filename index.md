Comments-

“I am really happy with the work Jill has planned and carried out with my son. Already within the last couple of weeks I have noticed improvements in his work. She also keeps me updated with his progress, and she has lesson plans that are created for him in order to enhance his individual learning. I would highly recommend Jill as a tutor.” Antonia Austin

“Thanks so much for all your help, you have put him in the right frame of mind and he seems very keen to learn now, so a great achievement. Many thanks again.” Paul Attridge

“I had Jill for four lessons and in that short period she managed to teach me so much. Before I had Jill I was very worried about my exam but now I am more confident. Jill explained everything really well and replied to my email very quickly. She planned everything before hand and was always organised. She goes through the topics thoroughly. She always makes the lesson interesting and she always made sure I was working hard. At the end of the lesson she would ask me a question to test me on what she taught me.”

“Really happy with how things are going. Adena is growing in confidence and enthusiasm to learn. The areas where help was need were identified in the first assessment. Have seen progress made from every lesson and a willingness from Adena not seen before. Learning has become positive and with understanding. Adena has moved from 3B to 4B in 6 months” Sharon Marzell December 2011

When asked what he thought of the lesson, M said “fantastic!” (Child, aged 9)

In 2012 she gained the National Accreditation for Special Needs Co-Ordinators and a Post Graduate Certificate in Action Research from Cambridge University. She has been a teacher in secondary schools for 30 years, the last 10 in an inner London Secondary School.

She has been a Head of History in 2 schools, teaching History successfully to A Level. In the academic year 2010-2011 she  tutored literacy on the government One to One scheme. She is now a Special Needs Co-ordinator in a primary school and a specialist dyslexia tutor. She also runs a successful Cub Scout group. This has given her excellent experience of students from the age of 5 years up to the age of 18.

She has enthusiastically taught GCSE & A Level History, all Humanities subjects and GCSE RE and can tutor primary school students to improve their English.  Jill will tutor your child for the 11+ examination and common entrance exams at 7,8 and 11 as well as any year in secondary  school including GCSE. She is CRB checked.

Quite often students can achieve great successes if only they are able to access a little more 1:1 time. This is the power of tutoring. Jill will tailor the lessons to the needs of the student, listening to the child, the parent and the school. Together we will unlock every student’s potential.
